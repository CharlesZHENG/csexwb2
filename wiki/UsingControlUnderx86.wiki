#Using the control in a x86 environment

Typical error message recieved after registering the COM component and attempting to run the DemoApp:

Retrieving the COM class factory for component 
with CLSID {A1FE23EF-03EF-4759-B021-668443C37A24} failed due to the 
following error: 80040154 (Class not registered)

*ROOTCAUSE*

The VSS Interop is a managed assembly using 32-bit Framework and the dll contains a 
32-bit COM object. If you run this COM dll in 64 bit environment, you will get the 
error message.

*WORKAROUND*

The possible workaround is modify your project's platform from 'Any CPU' to 'X86' 
(in Project's Properties, Build/Platform's Target)
